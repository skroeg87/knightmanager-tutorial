<h1 id="welcome-to-knight-manager-tutorial">Welcome to the Knight-Manager Tutorial</h1>
<p>This tutorial is designed to help beginners get started in the world of RitterManager. The tutorial can be used either as a step-by-step guide to the game or as a reference for game-related matters.<br />
To quickly navigate to a section, use the table of contents at the top of this page.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-knight-manager">What is Knight Manager?</h2>
<p>Knight Manager is an audio-based game for Amazon Alexa devices. The game is controlled exclusively through voice commands. The interaction always takes place with your Echo device and the Knight Manager Alexa skill. In addition to the game, there is also a [website](https://www.knight-manager.com/) where you can gather information about your knight, view the battle and hunting rankings, and find news about the game. It also provides organized information about provinces, orders, and legends. If you're currently feeling lost, don't worry. We haven't even started the actual game yet. :-)<br />
If you don't own an Echo device, you can alternatively play the game through the Alexa app on your smartphone, tablet, or Windows PC. However, there are some limitations in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>You won't be able to make in-skill purchases, such as buying diamonds.</li>
<li>The Dark Forest and automatic battles may not work or have limited functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, it is recommended to get an Echo device if you plan to play the game for an extended period and want to be successful.<br />
Sometimes during the game, you may not want to listen to the entire output of a given voice command. You can skip the output at any time by simply giving a new command. By doing this, you will only miss the audio output, as the calculations for that point in the game have already been completed. It is not necessary to let all outputs play through every time.<br />
If you ever didn't understand something, you can always have the output repeated. Just say "Repeat."</p>
    
<h2 id="creating-knights">Creating a Knight</h2>
<p>First, we need to create a knight, which will be your character that you'll play with. To do this, simply open the skill on your Echo device by saying, "Alexa, open Knight Manager." If you're using a different wake word, use that instead of "Alexa." Alternatively, on Echo devices with an action button, you can also give a voice command after pressing the button.<br />
Once the skill is opened, you'll hear the sound of a sword followed by a brief introduction. Now, follow the steps described there to give your knight a name. Afterward, your individual character will be created and you're ready to go.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: If you deactivate the skill and later reactivate it, a new knight will be created. So be careful with commands like "Deactivate Knight Manager," as Alexa will execute it without confirmation.</p>    

<h2 id="linking-knights-with-your-amazon-account">Linking Your Knight to Your Amazon Account</h2>
<p>Before you proceed, it's recommended to link your knight to your Amazon account. This has the advantage of earning you 10 diamonds as a reward for the account link every day, and it allows you to view your profile on the website later on. Additionally, linking your knight to your Amazon account provides an extra layer of security because if you deactivate and reactivate the skill, you can restore your knight by simply linking the skill to your Amazon account again.<br />
To link the skill to your account, open the Alexa app on your smartphone or tablet, go to the RitterManager skill page, and select "Settings." Then choose "Link Account" and follow the on-screen instructions on your device.</p>

<h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>
<p>Since everything is now done for the start, it's time to get a first overview of your knight and the world of Knight-Manager in general.</p>
    
<h2> id="attributes-of-your-knight">Attibutes of your knight</h2>
<p>An essential part of the game is to continuously improve your knight's characteristics, strengthening him for future challenges such as adventures or battles, and ultimately leading him to success. To hear an overview of the traits, simply say "My Knight". Afterwards you have the possibility to learn more about the combat traits or the hunting traits. Alternatively, you can say "My combat traits" or "My hunting traits" directly.</p>
    
    <h3 id="combat-attributes">Combat Attributes</h3>
    <p>Your knight's combat attributes are the basic building block for successful battles in the arena. Your knight has the following attributes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Health Points: Health points determine how much damage your knight can take before being defeated in a fight.</li>
      <li>Strength: The higher your strength, the higher the damage dealt when you hit your opponent.</li>
      <li>Defense: Defense is the opposite attribute to Strength. The higher it is, the less damage your opponent can do to you with one hit.</li>
      <li>Luck: The higher your luck, the more likely you are to hit your opponent.</li>
      <li>Speed: The higher your speed, the more likely you are to dodge your opponent. Also, a high speed ensures that you can start the fight with a higher probability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Luck and speed also help you to get a small bonus on your damage or to reduce your opponent's damage a bit. A good balance of your combat stats is therefore very important.</p>
    <p>If you want to specifically query one of these combat values, just say "My Strength" or any other attribute to learn more about it, for example. This way you'll also get the exact split between base value, the additional points from bonus traits or temporary effects (e.g. from food) as well as the blacksmith upgrades for strength and defense and the upgrades in the Order Hall for luck and speed. Also, this way you don't have to listen to all the other stats if you only want to check one specific one.</p>
 
    
    <h3 id="hunting-attributes">Hunting Attributes</h3>
    <p>Besides combat, there is another discipline in the game in which you can train your knight, Hunting in the Dark Forest. The following attributes can be trained here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Breakthrough Power: Breakthrough Power is used to calculate the damage when you hit an enemy while hunting.</li>
      <li>Aim: The higher, the more likely you are to hit an enemy while hunting.</li>
      <li>Read Tracks: The better you are at reading tracks, the more likely you are to find an enemy while hunting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As in combat, a good distribution of points is crucial for successful results in hunting. The hunt properties can be queried at any time with the "My hunt" command.</p>
    
     <h3 id="special-abilities">Special Abilities</h3>
    <p>Besides the fighting and hunting abilities, there are other special abilities that your knight can gain. Here, too, a distinction is made between fighting and hunting. We will look at the abilities in detail later, when we deal with the store and the hunting lodge.</p>
    
     <h3 id="bonus-attributes">Bonus Attributes</h3>
    <p>To help your knight succeed even more effectively, you can equip him with powerful bonus attributes. These either increase the attributes for combat or hunting by a few points or give you some other advantage. Bonus attributes for combat are bought in the store, those for hunting in the hunting lodge. The "Shop" and "Hunting lodge" sections go into more detail about the available bonuses.</p>
    
     <h3 id="combat-class">Combat Class</h3>
    <p>Finally, there is one last characteristic of your knight, the so-called combat class. Each combat class gives your knight an advantage as well as a special combat title. This can be heard later in many places in the game, for example in fights in the arena or when another player is looking for your knight.</p>
<p>At the beginning, your character does not have a special combat title and is therefore not yet assigned to a combat class. The assignment to a class takes place every Wednesday at 12 o'clock during the battle class evaluation. The deciding factor for which combat class your knight will be assigned to is your game activity. The more you do in the game, the more active you are and the better you will do in the battle class evaluation. Anything that requires an in-game command counts as activity. So the Dark Forest or automatic combat do not count as game activity.</p>
<p>NOTE: Combat classes are dynamic and you can drop from a high class to a lower class if you have been less active in a week. So, if you want to keep your class or if you want to gradually move up, you should be active in the game.</p>
<p>There are 14 combat classes in total, which give you the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scout: More experience in the daily adventures</li>
<li>Corporal: Adventures cost your knight less energy</li>
<li>Sergeant: 5% more speed</li>
<li>Senior Sergeant: 5% more luck</li>
<li>First Sergeant: 10% discount at the blacksmith</li>
<li>Knight: More honor points from won battles</li>
<li>Bloodguard: 5% more defense</li>
<li>Legionnaire: 10% more experience points when winning fights</li>
<li>Centurion: 5% more strength</li>
<li>Champion: More diamonds for gifts from the king</li>
<li>Commander: 10% more gold per hour from your serfs</li>
<li>General: Allows you to buy and use the epic combat skill "Bow Shot"</li>
<li>Warlord: Allows you to buy and use the epic combat ability "Drain Life"</li>
<li>High Warlord: Allows you to purchase and use the epic combat ability "Curse of Agony"</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also check how active you are at the moment. Just say "My activity". You will hear your activity rank. This determines how many battle class points you can receive in the battle class evaluation. These battle class points are then used to determine your battle class. Unlike the activity, you cannot query the battle class points.</p>
<p>There are 14 activity ranks in total. However, your activity rank does not necessarily determine which combat class you will move up to or whether you will move down. However, you should make sure that you have an activity rank of at least 5 or higher, because every Wednesday 10% of the battle class points you have collected so far will be lost and you will most likely not be relegated.</p>
   
    
    <h2 id="other-important-building-blocks">Other important components</h2>
    <p>In addition to the combat, hunting, and bonus traits, there are several other stats and building blocks of the game that are important to you and your knight:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Level: With each level your knight gains, you get one skill point. You can use this to improve one of the attributes for combat. The level increases as you gain experience points. You can get them in battle, during daily adventures or in the black tower. One skill point improves the base value by 10 points, except for health points, which are increased by 20 per point.</li>
<li>Hunting Level: As in combat, you can award a skill point for a hunting trait after reaching a new hunting level. The hunting level increases as you gain experience points hunting in the Dark Forest.</li>
<li>Honor: Your honor points determine your ranking on the leaderboard. The more you have, the better your ranking in the Knight Ranking. You get glory points by winning fights. However, if you lose a battle, you will also lose some honor points.</li>
<li>Gold: This is the main currency in the game. There is no limit to how much gold you can have.</li>
<li>Servants: Servants produce new gold for you every hour. They can be stolen from other knights in battle, in the black tower, at the fair, or during daily adventures and in the Dark Forest.</li>
<li>Arrowmakers: The arrowmakers produce arrows for you every hour, which are needed for hunting in the Dark Forest. You can learn more about the arrow makers in the "Arrow Workshop" section.</li>
<li>Energy: Many actions in the game cost your knight energy points. Every hour you will receive additional energy, unless you have reached the maximum possible energy. Say "my energy" for more information. You can also buy energy at any time for diamonds and also beyond your maximum energy.</li>
<li>Diamonds: Diamonds are very valuable. They can be found in the game or bought for real money. With them you can, for example, unlock upgrades at the blacksmith without waiting, buy bonus traits and skills in the store, or replenish your knight with new energy if you don't want to wait for the next hour.</li>
<li>Player number: This number uniquely identifies your knight and helps in case of technical problems or player search if another knight can't find you with your name.</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>To query one of these values, say for example "my gold" or any other of the mentioned values. You will get some useful information about it.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT:</em> To query the position on the ranking list and your fame points, say "ranking list". The commands "fame", "my fame points" or "my fame" are not accepted.</p>
    
    <h3 id="seasons">Seasons</h3>
    <p>In order not to get bored in Knight-Manager, the game is turn-based. A turn is called a season here. Each season lasts at least 6 months. So every player has the possibility to compete under fair conditions even against longtime players. A central part of the season is the Order. In the section "Order" the end of a season as well as the start of a new season is described in detail.</p>
    
    <h3 id="leaderboard">Leaderboard</h3>
    <p>To conclude this section, here is some information about the ranking system in Knight-Manager:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Knight Ranking is divided into four leagues: League A, B, C and D.</li>
<li>The place in the ranking is decided by the honor points</li>
      <li>League A contains the top 50 players measured by honor points</li>
<li>League B contains the places 51 to 150 measured by the honor points, in total there are 100 places in league B.</li>
<li>League C contains the places 151 to 300 measured by the honor points, so in total there are 150 places in league C.</li>
<li>League D contains all other players. The ranking is also based on the honor points.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you want to query the best knights in the skill, just say "Top ten". Alternatively, you have the option to view the ranking clearly on the website of Knight-Manager.</p>
  
    <h4 id="specifics-of-the-beginner-ranking">Specifics of the beginner ranking</h4>
    
    <p>As a newcomer, you compete exclusively with the players who are together with you in the beginner ranking. This gives you the opportunity to fight as a beginner in a fair environment and to try yourself out in peace. Unlike the regular ladder, the beginner ladder has a few special features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Players from the regular ladder cannot attack you, even if they are specifically looking for you.</li>
<li>The beginner ladder contains its own four leagues A to D</li>
    </ul>
<p>Otherwise, as a beginner, you can interact normally with other players from the regular ladder. From the next season on, you will automatically play in the regular ladder.</p>
